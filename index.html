                That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web

            <p>A developer is an individual that builds and create software and applications. He or she writes, debugs
                and executes the source code of a software application. A developer is also known as a software

                <p>My personal definition of a professional developer is a developer who is able to build and maintain a
                    commercial piece of software. In other words, if said developer made or edited software, and that
                    software is generating money for someone somewhere even indirectly, then the developer who made it
                    is
                    professional</p>
